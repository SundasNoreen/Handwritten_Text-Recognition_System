# Handwritten_Text-Recognition_System

Handwritten character recognition (HCR) is the detection of characters from images, documents
and other sources and changes them in machine-readable shape for further processing. The
accurate recognition of intricate-shaped compound handwritten characters is still a great challenge.
The problem of text recognition is becoming increasingly important due to the active introduction
of digital computing and the widespread use of word processors. Pattern recognition is one of the
most difficult from a mathematical point of view and one of the most popular areas of artificial
intelligence programming.
The project uses the CNN and RNN approach to develop a handwritten text recognition system
that converts a line of handwritten text from image to machine readable form. The model is trained
on IAM dataset using TensorFlow libraries of python and the UI is designed in HTML and CSS.

The model is trained on IAM Dataset. The IAM Handwriting Database contains forms of
handwritten English text which can be used to train and test handwritten text recognizers and to
perform writer identification and verification experiments. The database contains forms of
unconstrained handwritten text, which were scanned at a resolution of 300dpi and saved as PNG
images with 256 gray levels.
