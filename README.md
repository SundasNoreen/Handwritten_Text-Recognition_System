# Handwritten Text Recognition System

Handwriting Recognition or Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) which is a challenging problem statement. The high variance in handwriting styles across people and poor quality of the handwritten text compared to printed text pose significant hurdles in converting it to machine readable text. Nevertheless, it's a crucial problem to solve for multiple industries like healthcare, insurance and banking.

The model is trained on IAM Dataset. The IAM Handwriting Database contains forms of handwritten English text which can be used to train and test handwritten text recognizers and to perform writer identification and verification experiments. The database contains forms of unconstrained handwritten text, which were scanned at a resolution of 300dpi and saved as PNG images with 256 gray levels. 

We have used a NN for our task. It contained convolutional NN (CNN) layers, recurrent NN (RNN) layers and a final Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layer.
